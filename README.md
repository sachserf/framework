# framework
this package provides functions to standardize the structure of R-projects. Furthermore it is straightforward to save snapshots of folders (e.g. the project folder) or files in a standardized way (possibly interesting for file transfer and collaboration). The functions should support the reproducibility of projects.

## Installation
devtools::install_github("sachserf/framework")
